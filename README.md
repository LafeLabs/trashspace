# TRASHSPACE

A trashspace is a space where people come together to build technology from trash for distribution directly into their communities.  

The main elements of the TRASHSPACE are:

1. STEAM(Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math) education directed at teaching people how to *build* things which they can sell, barter, or provide free to the community[(TRASH ACADEMY)](https://github.com/LafeLabs/trashacademy)
2. Research in building self-replicating technology from trash which can be used to provide all human needs to our direct community
3. A safe, free and warm place to be where free food and child care are provided

TRASHSPACE's try to avoid needing funding by running on volunteer labor in existing spaces.  This can be classrooms, schools, religious institutions, art spaces/galleries, maker spaces of all kinds, or just homes.  We sell the customers of our products on the IDEA of building a new civilization from trash in which everything is free and we eliminate mining and extraction completely.  If people believe in our mission they will pay for our products and services, which will fund the research and development which will lead to more and better products, and that will create the feedback loops to scale.

Teachers can get funded through existing educational programs, add curriculum if they are already paid to teach, volunteer, or apply for educational grants to support teaching without charging students.  Teachers guiding students in doing research can also raise grant money to support their own salaries and those of the students, which can be done through existing educational institutions like universities.  But even in the case of research, all work is directed toward a deliverable product or service which the students can trade for other goods and services to grow the project.
