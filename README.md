# TRASHSPACE

A trashspace is a space where people come together to build technology from trash for distribution directly into their communities.  

The main elements of the TRASHSPACE are:

1. STEAM(Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math) education directed at teaching people how to build things from trash which are of direct use to their community
2. Research in building self-replicating technology from trash which can be used to provide all human needs to our direct community
3. A safe and warm place to be where free food and child care are provided
4. Production of [TRASHCORE](https://github.com/LafeLabs/trashcore) products to sell to support the project and its growth
