# TRASHSPACE

A trashspace is a space where people come together to build technology from trash for distribution directly into their communities.  Our goal is to create a new civilization from only trash and sun which provide all the elements of a good life to all people for free. We aim to eliminate all mining and other extraction industries by 2050.

The main elements of the TRASHSPACE are:

1. STEAM(Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math) education directed at teaching people how to *build* things which they can sell, barter, or provide free to the community[(TRASH ACADEMY)](https://github.com/LafeLabs/trashacademy)
2. Research in building self-replicating technology from trash which can be used to provide all human needs to our direct community
3. A safe, free and warm place to be where free food and child care are provided

**location** TRASHSPACE's try to avoid needing funding by running on volunteer labor in existing spaces.  This can be classrooms, schools, religious institutions, art spaces/galleries, maker spaces of all kinds, public libraries, museums, or just homes.  

**replication** We sell the customers of our products on the IDEA of building a new civilization from trash in which everything is free and we eliminate mining and extraction completely.  If people believe in our mission they will pay for our products and services even if they are only marginally useful(pure art).  If this stimulates the sharing of media which brings in new people who hear our story and believe, it will fuel a process of viral self-replication. 

**funding** People can get funded through existing educational programs to teach or create curriculum.  We do not apply for grants to do research, but rather educational grants to teach students how to do research, who then are able to pursue research free of any constraints of R&D funding priorities.  Our only constraint is that the student learn the STEAM material which would normally be funded for education.  Rather than build a new institute or foundation, we will join the work of TRASHSPACES into existing institutions and raise grants through those organizations, which will then support everyone as employees or contractors.
